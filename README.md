Solutions to exercises in the book "Elementary Standard ML" written in Poly/ML.

Although SML and Poly/ML are very similar, there are some subtle differences. The parts relating to I/O are almost entirely dissimilar, at least compared to the point when this book was written. Therefore, it might be of use for anyone who wishes to learn Poly/ML to have a solution set for a book teaching SML, especially since (to my knowledge) there are no books focusing exclusively on Poly/ML.

Solutions for some very trivial exercises in chapters 2 and 3 are omitted. Also, solutions requiring a written answer instead of a program are omitted. Solutions to Chapter 11 are almost altogether omitted, due to the differences between SML and Poly/ML with regards to input from prompt.
