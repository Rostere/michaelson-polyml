Solutions to exercises in the book "Elementary Standard ML" by Greg Michaelson, written in Poly/ML instead of SML.

Poly/ML can be found on Github with simple instructions on how to install: <https://github.com/polyml/polyml>.

I encourage everyone to buy the physical book, but if you should not have the material means to do so, the book can be found in digital version at the author's home page: <http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~greg/books>. It should be noted that the digital version was last updated in 2002, while these solutions are based on the version from 1995.

Although SML and Poly/ML are very similar, there are some subtle differences. The parts relating to I/O are almost entirely dissimilar, at least compared to the point when this book was written. Therefore, it might be of use for anyone who wishes to learn Poly/ML to have a solution set for a book teaching SML, especially since (to my knowledge) there are no books focusing exclusively on Poly/ML.

Solutions for some very trivial exercises in chapters 2 and 3 are omitted. Also, solutions requiring a written answer instead of a program are omitted. Solutions to Chapter 11 are almost altogether omitted, due to the differences between SML and Poly/ML with regards to input from prompt.
