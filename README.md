Solutions to exercises in the book "Elementary Standard ML" written in Poly/ML.

Although SML and Poly/ML are very similar, there are some subtle differences. The parts relating to I/O are almost entirely dissimilar, at least compared to the point when this book was written. Therefore, it might be of use for anyone who wishes to learn Poly/ML to have a solution set for a book teaching SML, especially since (to my knowledge) there are no books focusing exclusively on Poly/ML.

Solutions for some very trivial exercises at the start of the book are omitted.
